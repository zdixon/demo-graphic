Fumeng's add-ups

1. I tried to compile the project using a higher version of CMake.
2. When compiling locally, I try to compile it to an Eclispe project.
If you don't have eclipse CDT install, the compiling may fail
3. When adding code, I recommend (1) adding a CMakeLists.txt to that directory
(2) add the directory to the most outer cmakelists
(3) add the library to the cmakelists.txt with the exe entry
